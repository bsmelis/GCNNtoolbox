# GCNNtoolbox
  Generalized Classifier Neural Network
  
  Generalized Classifier Neural Network is a classifier utilizing regression concept in classification. It is based on RBFNN. 
  Toolbox includes two different learning algorithms published in https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608012003164 and https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608014001993?via%3Dihub
  
 
To be able to use toolbox, follow the steps:


1) Run toolboxgcnn.m file in MATLAB

2) Choose your train and test data through GUI


3) Your data must be in the following format:

        Each row must represent a datum.
        Features can be separated by single space or comma.
        Class labels (categorical or numeric) must be in the last column
